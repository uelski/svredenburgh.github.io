# Jaco Says
### This first project is a play off of the classic Simon Says game using nine bass tones in a randomly generated pattern the users must follow. I incorporated JQuery with Sass/HTML to track a player's score, switch players, declare a winner and start a new game.

## Approach:
### I used online tutorials for the original Simon Says game as a guide, and narrowed down the scope of the project to only involve one musical key, C Major. I then bounced out small mp3 files of the notes in the key to correspond to each of the nine pads. I created a function to randomly generate a pattern, then add more notes as the player goes through each round. Another function compared what pads the player selected, then determined if they were correct. Once the first player loses a round, the second player is up, and when the second player loses a winner is determined, and the game restarts.
